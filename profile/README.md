# Welcome to Woodpecker CI

**Woodpecker CI** is a lightweight, community-driven CI application for self-hosted environments.
We believe in the power of open source to streamline and simplify continuous integration—ensuring that developers can focus on building great software rather than wrestling with complex pipelines.
